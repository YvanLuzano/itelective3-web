## LGU - Cotabato Payroll System

This is for a payroll management system that is created for the Local Government Unit - Cotabato. The system will take a look at the employee names, as well as the department they are working at. Everything about the basic information of the empoyee together with his/her information that is relevant to the company. With this in mind, it will be easier for HR to view their payroll and release their salary.

### &emsp;How it works
&emsp; The program will ask for the name of the employee and searches the database for the information about the employee input. Once done, the employee will see the payroll details.
